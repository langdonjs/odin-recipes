    <p>Pineapple bars are a sweet treat â€“ the consistency is soft and moist, almost like a cake, but you cut it into squares and eat it like you would a brownie or a blondie!</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>Can pinapple rings</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>white sugarn</li>
        <li>pineapple juice</li>
        <l1>lemon juice</l1>
        <l1>vanilla extract</l1>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <l1><strong>Step 1</strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment to have overhang on all sides; spray the parchment with nonstick spray.</l1>
        <l1><strong>Step 2</strong>Remove 8 or 9 pineapple rings from the can and pat them dry with a paper towel. Measure out 1/2 cup pineapple juice from the can, and set aside to use for the batter. Reserve any remaining pineapple rings and remaining pineapple juice for another use.</l1>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>Pat maraschino cherries with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>Place pineapple rings in an even layer in the bottom of the pan, trimming as necessary to fit. Add the cherries to the pan, placing them in and around the pineapple rings, making whatever decorative pattern you would like. Sprinkle pineapple and cherries with the 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>In a large bowl, whisk together melted butter, white sugar, and the 1/4 cup brown sugar until thoroughly combined. Add in 1/2 cup reserved pineapple juice, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Stir until mixture looks curdled. Add in the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and whisk until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong>Place dollops of batter over prepared pineapple and cherries, and gently spread into an even layer with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong>Bake in the preheated oven until edges of the bars are golden brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes. A toothpick inserted near the center should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong>Allow bars to cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Carefully invert onto a plate or platter, and gently remove parchment paper. Allow to cool completely. Once bars are cool, carefully run a knife or a long, thin spatula underneath the bars to loosen them from the plate or platter. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
